Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm,
where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. 
It’s used to predict values within a continuous range,(e.g.  price,sales).

simple linear regression-
With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients
Simple linear regression uses traditional slope-intercept form, where 
m and b are the variables our algorithm will try to “learn” to produce the most accurate predictions. x
represents our input data and y represents our prediction.
			y=m*x+b

Multivariable regression-
One more complex, multi-variable linear equation may look like this, where w
represents the coefficients(weights), from which our model will try to learn.
			f(X,Y,Z)=W1*X+W2*Y+W3*Z
			where:	
				X,Y,Z are the variables which are representing the attributes
 			sales=W1*MOBILE + W2*BATTERIES + W3*COVER +.........+Wn*N
