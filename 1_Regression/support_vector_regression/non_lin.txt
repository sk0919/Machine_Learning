here we are using svr (non linear classifier)-
support vector regressor classifier is very helpful for classifing things non linearly
-we can use different type of non linear kernel which can give quite impressive result for 
predictors
'rbf' kernel is the gaussian kernel
'rbf' and 'poly' gives a very nice result
default kernel is the (rbf)

features scaling is required for the support vector regressor
--this class is less common for the regression so this may be the cause for 
  exclusion of this part(feature scaling).

svr is helpful in detecting outlier   ;)


note
------always check datatype of the arguments which should be passed inside the method 
otherwise it will give an error or it might be the cause of an error
